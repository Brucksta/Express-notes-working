## Express-notes

Link to deployed app : https://pb-express-notes.herokuapp.com/

## Description:
Express notes in an application made as a simple, easy to use note tracker, which will allow the user to keep on top of tasks and write themselves reminders. The app runs off its own local hosted server, using npm start in an intergrated terminal on the server.js file. It is also being hosted on Heroku for ease of access.
The starting HTML and CSS was given to me, aswell as a lot of functional javascript to make the HTML work as required. As the developer I was required to run the serverside, and set up all the routing. I used get requests to set up the homepage with default / and then linked the working notes page of /notes, which was generated by clicking the start button on the landing page. 

Through making this app ive learnt how to control a server of my own, and make the HTML/javascript request to the server, store data in the database file and then respond it back to the page. This has taught me a lot of extra functionality that I can add to future projects, as ill be able to have a lot of access to saved data that is generated through the websites use.

## Installation:
Using node, run npm intall express.  

## Usage:
Simply run the server.js file in an intergrated terminal, and run npm start.

During the creating of my initial repository, the public file was lost, and between myself and my lecturer at uni, we were unable to fix and repush the file. The only option we could find is to start a new repo, although it means my repo commit log is 1. Below is an imagine of my initial repository containing the real commit number of 6.
My initial repo can be found here, with the full build log, although the public file has been irrevesibly lost, but all changes can still be viewed: https://github.com/Brucksta/Express-notes
